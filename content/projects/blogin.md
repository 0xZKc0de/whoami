A full-stack blogging ecosystem designed for scalability and secure content management, inspired by platforms like Medium.

### Core Architecture
- **Multi-Role System**: Featuring dedicated dashboards for both Content Creators (Bloggers) and System Administrators.
- **Robust Security**: Fully secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication and role-based access control.
- **Modern Stack**: Leverages Spring Boot for a high-performance REST API and Angular for a responsive, dynamic frontend.
- **Data Integrity**: Uses PostgreSQL for reliable relational data storage and complex query handling.

The platform provides a seamless writing experience with powerful administrative oversight tools.
