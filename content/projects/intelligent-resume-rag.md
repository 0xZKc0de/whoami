Developed during my internship, this project addresses the challenge of efficiently parsing and querying large volumes of resume data using state-of-the-art LLM techniques.

### Core Contributions
- **Intelligent RAG Pipeline**: Built a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to provide precise answers to complex queries regarding candidate profiles.
- **Data Orchestration**: Designed robust document parsing and vector retrieval workflows using DocType, ChromaDB, and OpenAI embeddings for high-fidelity information retrieval.
- **DevOps Excellence**: Established automated CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, streamlining the build and deployment of Dockerized microservices.

The system significantly reduces the time recruiters spend on initial resume screening by providing an interactive, conversational interface to candidate data.
