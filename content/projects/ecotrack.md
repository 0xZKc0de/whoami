Mobile application designed to help individuals track and reduce their carbon footprint through daily activity monitoring.

### Highlights
- **Activity Tracking**: Automatically detects transport mode (walking, driving, cycling).
- **Gamification**: Earn badges and compete with friends on leaderboards.
- **Impact limitations**: Visualizes CO2 saved in real-world terms (e.g., trees planted).

Winner of the "Best Green Tech" award at the 2023 University Hackathon.
